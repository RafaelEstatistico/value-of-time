## Abstract

In this paper, we discuss the methodological procedures and the computation of the value of travel time saving and value of statistical life in air travels in Brazil. A stated preference experiment was carried out, in which we bring some innovations in order to control for hypothetical bias. 

## Keywords

- value of mortality risk reduction
- Value of travel time saving 
- Stated preference 
- Discrete choice modelling
